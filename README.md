## About

Coming from a background in native Android development, I've decided to broaden my skills by exploring the React ecosystem. This project leverages React, TypeScript, and Vite to create a fast, modern development environment. It's a work in progress, where I'll be experimenting with new concepts and sharing my learning journey.
